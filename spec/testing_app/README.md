# Testing App for the Tracker

To test recording page views, start the server for the tracker from `tracker/`
with `bundle exec rails server` and start the testing app server from
`spec/testing_app/` with `bundle exec rails server --port 3001`. You can now
visit [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) and see the tracker in
action.
